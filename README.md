Epiphanee is a lightweight site that allows people to share ideas without user registeration; interactions are logged via IP addresses. Every upvote, downvote, and post is recorded in a MySQL database, along with the IP address of whoever performed the action. The site also includes a Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam and has a "auto ban" system (so don't post any naughty things ;) ).

Note that I was inexperienced with file paths at the time, so all the paths are absolute, meaning that merely cloning the files and running them won't work. Not only that, but you'll need a program like XAMPP to run the PHP. If you want to see the site in action, don't worry, you can visit it right here: epiphanee.org
