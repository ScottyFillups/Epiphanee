		Whenever you post an idea, it is no longer your intellectual property. The idea becames "fair game": it belongs to everyone. Hypothetically, people could claim your 
		ideas as their own and refuse to give credit. While doing such a thing in unethical (at least in our eyes), we are not obligated to take any action in forcing 
		others to give credit to the users of this site. You must be prepared to surrender your idea completely. 
		As stated on the homepage, if you plan to pursue your idea, <b>do not post it here</b>.

		We also store your IP address whenever you upvote or downvote something. We do this to prevent people from upvoting or downvoting the same thing several times.
