				<h4 class="greenbox">Sorta...</h4>
				<p>
					Both the concepts and development of the site was done entirely by Philip Scott. He used HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, and mySQL. The site was mostly designed by Philip as well; however,
					many of his friends provided suggestions that improved the site drastically. We'd like to thank...
